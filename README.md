# Surus

A collection of tools for analysis in Pig and Hive.

# Description

Over the next year we plan to release a handful of our internal user defined functions (UDFâ€™s) that have broad adoption across Netflix.  The use cases for these functions are varied in nature (e.g. scoring predictive models, outlier detection, pattern matching, etc.) and together extend the analytical capabilities of big data.

# Functions

* ScorePMML - A tool for scoring predictive models in the cloud.
